# Password Generator

**DISCLAIMER: THIS APPLICATION DOES NOT YET GENERATE CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY SECURE PASSWORDS.** 

While this password should be fine for things like Twitter, Facebook, etc, I am not responsible for any outcome resulting from or otherwise relating to this application in any way. 

For all practical purposes, until officially stated otherwise, **THIS APPLICATION IS IN ITS PRE-ALPHA PHASE**.

## Description

![Alt text](assets\images\screenshotPWGEN.png "Optional Title")

This is a password generator created using JavaScript. This was a huge learning experience, and while there are still a few things I'm working out, it's generally how I envisioned it. I went into this knowing almost nothing about JavaScript, and although I most definitely have a lot more to learn, I believe I now have a solid foundation to build upon.

## Installation

Clone to your local machine and open in your favorite code editor to check it out! Or visit the deployed version at: [Password Generator on GitHub Pages](https://alexgignilliat.github.io/Password-Generator/)

## Technologies Utilized

HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 4, JavaScript

## Roadmap, Important Notes, etc

I started building this application at a time when I was just getting my feet wet with JavaScript. That being said, the end goal for this application is to provide the user with a cryptographically secure password for things like:

- Cryptocurrency wallets (Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, etc.)
- Devices like computers, phones and tablets that demand the highest possible security (Work devices, devices used for finances, etc.)
- Stock Market/Forex/Cryptocurrency exchanges
- Etc, etc, etc...

â€œRemember to look up at the stars and not down at your feet. Try to make sense of what you see and wonder about what makes the Universe exist. Be curious. And however difficult life may seem, there is always something you can do and succeed at. It matters that you don't just give up."  - Stephen Hawking
